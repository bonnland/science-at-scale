# CAM6 Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) Reanalysis Cloud-Optimized Dataset


## Overview

This is a cloud-hosted subset of the CAM6 Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) Reanalysis dataset. These data products are designed to facilitate a broad variety of research using NCAR's CESM2 models, ranging from model evaluation to (ensemble) hindcasting, data assimilation experiments, and sensitivity studies. They come from an 80 member ensemble reanalysis of the global troposphere and stratosphere using DART and CAM6 from CESM2.1. The data products represent the actual states of the atmosphere from 2011 through 2020 at a 1 degree horizontal resolution and 6 hourly frequency. Each ensemble member is an equally likely description of the atmosphere, and is also consistent with dynamics and physics of CAM6. This  dataset is derived from the "CAM6 Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) Reanalysis", DOI:10.5065/JG1E-8525

## Data Characteristics

## Zarr format

The LENS data on AWS are structured according to the Zarr storage format. There are independent Zarr stores for each time frequency/variable combination. The naming convention is: {frequency}/{variable}.zarr where:

- frequency = weekly or hourly6
- variable = one of the variable names listed in the table below.

The table shows available Zarr stores, including the variables, time ranges, and 2D or 3D nature (3D means multiple atmosphere levels).
